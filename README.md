the django app that powers the wulf.

## guidelines
any features, bugs, or cleanup tasks must be captured in the issue collector.
- a feature request consists of a title, the explanation of the new feature, the functionality of the new feature, and the plan to execute the new feature (essentially a timeline).
- bugs should be reported with a traceback if possible and when solved should include a test to prove the bug is fixed.
- cleanup/maintenance tasks should be captured in detail and should only ever be executed by someone who knows what they are doing.
